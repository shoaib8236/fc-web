            Delivery. &nbsp;&ldquo;OnDemand! Now!&rdquo; Food Delivery is our
            Food Delivery innovation whereby FoodChoo creates an active platform
            that allows small restaurants to make food first and then sell it
            via means of pop up menus and delivery vehicles in a targeted area.
            &nbsp;Only potential customers in an area will receive notifications
            that food is available via push notifications that the eater has to
            opt in to.

            You understand that our Vendors offer their Goods in specific

            area. By entering your delivery address on the Platform, you will
            see the Vendors that we make available to you at that time. Delivery
            areas may expand, shrink or change depending on traffic and weather
            conditions.

            of an Order when you click on &lsquo;My Orders&rsquo; on the

        <p>
          <span>
            To the extent permitted by law, FoodChoo (which shall include its
            employees, directors, agents, representatives, affiliates and parent
            company) exclude all liability (whether arising in contract, in
            negligence or otherwise) for loss or damage which you or any third
            party may incur in connection with our Platform, our services, and
            any website linked to our Platform and any content or material
            posted on it. Your exclusive remedy with respect to your use of the
            Platform is to discontinue your use of the Platform. &nbsp;FoodChoo
            entities, their agents, representatives, and service providers shall
            not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential,

            regardless of the legal or equitable theory upon which the claim is
            based. Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the
            exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or
            incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, FoodChoo,
            FoodChoo entities, its agents, representatives and service
            providers&apos; liability shall be limited to the extent permitted
            by law.
